# Dairy Farm Management System

This is a project that tries to solve the challenges that the Dairy Farmers face.





## Problem

Dairy farmers face challenges of keeping records of the daily transactions taking place in their farms. Like a farmer with 100 heads of cattle, it becomes a challenge to keep track of each activity carried out on each cow like vaccination, insemination, deworming and also daily milk production.

This website tries to offer solution to dairy farmers by eliminating manual record keeping and coming up with a digital record keeping. Where farmers can manage and access their records online.

## Functionality
A dairy farmer purchases this website, then on the index page he can create an account and be assigned as an admin using a user level 3. Anybody who creates an account with this website is given a user level 1 where he/she can only see the farm profile. 

***Farm admin has the following priviledges.***

- View registered members,edit their details and assign them roles using user levels.(a user with user level 2 makes him/her a veterinary where he can login and register vaccination or insemination.)

- Register vaccination, insemination, daily production, and delete/edit unwanted records.
- Change his/her password and delete unwanted user accounts.
